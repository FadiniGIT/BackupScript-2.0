# BackupScript-2.0
Revamped simple ruby script to remotely copy and erase files - twitter to notify the user of process

Requires the twitter gem for tweeting funcionality

Set up with cron for scheduled backup offloads...

I also had to make a script to change permissions of the backup location folder on the remote machine...as my backup sets all permissions to root, and I needed to change it to my user
